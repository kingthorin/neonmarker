# Neonmarker

Continuation of the Zaproxy Neonmarker addon by [@juhakivekas](https://github.com/juhakivekas).

Neonmarker is a [@zaproxy](https://github.com/zaproxy/) addon which facilitates colouring of History table entries based on the Tags that have been applied to them (either by the Passive scanner or manually).

## Support

If you have problems or enhancement requests they can be raised as issues in this repository (just click the (Issues tab)[https://github.com/kingthorin/neonmarker/issues] above).

### Help

Basic help info is available via the wiki, including an example of how you can add color mappings via zap script.

## Backlog/TODO

### Order of tag rules can be dynamically changed in UI
- drag and drop?

### User can add colour by regex
- UI configurable passive scanning rule
- Custom Tagger extension?

### User can save colour mappings between sessions and projects
- database?
- xml?
- ZAP preference file?

### IDEAS
- Designer-picked colours "koodarivärit"
