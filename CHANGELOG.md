## [Unreleased]


## [1.7.0] - 2025-02-12
### Changed

## [1.6.0] - 2023-08-17
### Changed
- Maintenance changes.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-07-11
### Added
- A right-click context menu is now available in the History tab in order to Select/Set a color for arbitrary messages.

## [1.4.0] - 2021-08-26

### Changed
